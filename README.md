# Mighty

I'm working on a little 2D game engine and this will eventually become that. It's a bit messy and things will likely move around and change a lot.

### Requirements
This project is built in VisualStudio 2019 (should also work on 2015/7, just change the [batch file](./GenerateProjects.bat)).
This project is using C++17, but pretty much only uses C++11/14 features (smart pointers, etc)
This project uses a premake file, so you should be able to target *nix / mac os 

### Run
1. Run the `GenerateProjects.bat` script
2. Launch the `Mighty.sln` solution
3. Build/debug/run the game!
